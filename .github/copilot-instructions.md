# Project Context

This is a food delivery application for the restaurant **Masala and Curry** built as a modern monorepo. This app is dedicated to a single restaurant: "Masala and Curry".

The project includes:

- **Web App** (`apps/web`) - Customer-facing React application with TanStack Router
- **Mobile App** (`apps/mobile`) - Cross-platform React Native app with Expo
- **API Server** (`apps/server`) - Hono.js backend deployed on Cloudflare Workers
- **Shared Packages** - UI libraries and tooling for web/mobile platforms

### Tech Stack

- Frontend: React 19, React Native, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS/NativeWind
- Backend: Hono.js, Cloudflare Workers, D1 Database, Drizzle ORM
- Build: Turborepo, pnpm workspaces, Vite, Expo
- Authentication: Better Auth
- API: OpenAPI/Zod validation

### Key Patterns

- Monorepo with shared UI components (`@mac/web-ui`, `@mac/mobile-ui`)
- Type-safe API routes with OpenAPI schemas
- Consistent styling with Tailwind configuration packages
- Cross-platform mobile development with Expo Router

### Food Delivery Domain Rules

- Use clear, food-focused terminology (menu items, orders, restaurants)
- Do not implement multi-restaurant features. All logic and UI should assume only "Masala and Curry" is available.
- Implement proper order state management (pending, confirmed, preparing, delivered)
- Handle currency formatting consistently across platforms
- Validate food safety and allergen information properly
- Implement proper inventory management for menu items

### Monorepo Best Practices

- Use workspace references (`@mac/`) for internal packages
- Use consistent naming conventions across apps and packages
- Follow Turborepo conventions for build dependencies
- Use proper import/export patterns for shared components

### API Development (Hono.js/Cloudflare Workers)

- Use Zod schemas for all request/response validation
- Use [`HttpStatusCodes`](../apps/server/src/lib/constants/http-status-codes.ts) constants
- Follow OpenAPI specification patterns
- Use proper Cloudflare Workers patterns (no Node.js APIs)

### Environment-Specific Rules

#### Cloudflare Workers (`apps/server`)

- Don't use Node.js APIs (use Web APIs instead)
- Use Cloudflare bindings when accessing external services
- Implement proper edge caching strategies
- Use Hono.js middleware patterns

#### React Native (`apps/mobile`)

- Use Expo Router for navigation
- Follow React Native performance best practices
- Use NativeWind for consistent styling
- Implement proper platform-specific code when needed

#### Web App (`apps/web`)

- Use TanStack Router for routing
- Implement proper SEO optimization
- Use progressive enhancement patterns
- Follow web accessibility guidelines strictly
- Use HTML escape characters, like `'` can be escaped with `&apos;` or `&lsquo;` or `&#39;` or `&rsquo;`

## Prime Directive

- Avoid working on more than one file at a time.
- Multiple simultaneous edits to a file will cause corruption.
- Be chatting and teach about what you are doing while coding.
- If you need more context please ask yes or no questions.

## Large file & complex change protocol

### Mandatory planning phase

When working with large files (>300 lines) or complex changes:

1.  ALWAYS start by creating a detailed plan BEFORE making any edits
2.  Your plan MUST include:
    - All functions/sections that need modification
    - The order in which changes should be applied
    - Dependencies between changes
    - Estimated number of separate edits required

## Proposed edit plan

- Working with: [filename]
- Total planned edits: [number]

### Making edits

- Focus on one conceptual change at a time
- Show clear "before" and "after" snippets when proposing changes
- Include concise explanations of what changed and why
- Always check if the edit maintains the project's coding style

### Edit sequence:

    1. [First specific change] - Purpose: [why]
    2. [Second specific change] - Purpose: [why]
    3. Do you approve this plan? I'll proceed with Edit [number] after your confirmation.
    4. WAIT for explicit user confirmation before making ANY edits when user ok edit [number]

## Before Writing Code

1. Analyze existing patterns in the codebase
2. Consider edge cases and error scenarios
3. Follow the rules below strictly
4. Validate accessibility requirements

### EXECUTION PHASE

- After each individual edit, clearly indicate progress:
  "✅ Completed edit [#] of [total]. Ready for next edit?"
- If you discover additional needed changes during editing:
- STOP and update the plan
- Get approval before continuing

### REFACTORING GUIDANCE

When refactoring large files:

- Break work into logical, independently functional chunks
- Ensure each intermediate state maintains functionality
- Consider temporary duplication as a valid interim step
- Always indicate the refactoring pattern being applied

### RATE LIMIT AVOIDANCE

- For very large files, suggest splitting changes across multiple sessions
- Prioritize changes that are logically complete units
- Always provide clear stopping points

## Rules

### Accessibility (a11y)

- Don't use `accessKey` attribute on any HTML element.
- Don't set `aria-hidden="true"` on focusable elements.

- Accompany `onClick` with at least one of: `onKeyUp`, `onKeyDown`, or `onKeyPress`.
- Accompany `onMouseOver`/`onMouseOut` with `onFocus`/`onBlur`.
- Include caption tracks for audio and video elements.
- Use semantic elements instead of role attributes in JSX.
- Make sure all anchors are valid and navigable.
- Ensure all ARIA properties (`aria-*`) are valid.
- Use valid, non-abstract ARIA roles for elements with ARIA roles.

- Don't use the next/head module in pages/\_document.js on Next.js projects.

### Testing Best Practices

- Don't use export or module.exports in test files.
- Don't use focused tests.
- Make sure the assertion function, like expect, is placed inside an it() function call.
- Don't use disabled tests.

## Common Tasks

- `pnpm --filter @mac/mobile exec expo install` - Install dependencies for the mobile app
- `pnpm add -w` - Add a package to the workspace root

## Example: Error Handling

```typescript
// ✅ Good: Comprehensive error handling
try {
  const result = await fetchData();
  return { success: true, data: result };
} catch (error) {
  console.error("API call failed:", error);
  return { success: false, error: error.message };
}

// ❌ Bad: Swallowing errors
try {
  return await fetchData();
} catch (e) {
  console.log(e);
}
```

## Food Delivery Examples

### Menu Item Validation

```typescript
// ✅ Good: Comprehensive menu item validation
const menuItemSchema = z.object({
  name: z.string().min(1).max(100),
  description: z.string().max(500),
  price: z.number().nonnegative(),
  allergens: z.array(z.enum(["nuts", "dairy", "gluten"])),
  availability: z.boolean(),
  category: z.enum(["appetizer", "main", "dessert", "beverage"]),
});

// ❌ Bad: Missing validation
const menuItem = { name: req.body.name, price: req.body.price };
```

### Order State Management

```typescript
// ✅ Good: Clear order state transitions
const orderStates = [
  "pending",
  "confirmed",
  "preparing",
  "ready",
  "delivered",
] as const;
type OrderState = (typeof orderStates)[number];

// ❌ Bad: Magic strings
if (order.status === "processing") {
  /* unclear state */
}
```

### Architecture Decisions

#### When to Create New Packages

- UI components used across multiple apps
- Business logic shared between web and mobile
- Utility functions used in 3+ places
- Type definitions shared across boundaries

#### Component Library Organization

- `@mac/web-ui` - Web-specific React components
- `@mac/mobile-ui` - React Native components with NativeWind
- Shared design tokens in `@mac/tailwind-config`

#### API Design Patterns

- Use resource-based URLs (`/api/v1/orders`, `/api/v1/menu-items`)
- Implement consistent error response format
- Use proper HTTP methods and status codes
- Version APIs appropriately (`/api/v1/`)
